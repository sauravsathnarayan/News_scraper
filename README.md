Basic News Article Scraper that I made using beautifulsoup4 module.
Currently it scrapes news articles from nature.com.
But i will add more functionality to allow users to scrape their own article types from nature.com.
News articles are stored in textfiles. Textfiles don't have the entire article but rather a teaser. (working to display the entire article)
