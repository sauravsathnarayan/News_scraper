Basic News Article Scrape that I made using beautifulsoup4 module.
I created this as part of a larger project. Currently it scrapes news artilces from nature.com.
But i will add more functionality to allow user to scrape thier own article types from nature.com.
News articles ares stored in its own textfile which it created. Textfiles dont have the entire artilce but rather a teaser. (working to diaply the entire article)
